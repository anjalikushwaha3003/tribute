        <p class="para">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born Octo
            ber 15, 1931, Rameswaram, I
            ndia—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who
 played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.

            Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the
             Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence 
             Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved 
             to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project
              director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle 
              that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO 
              in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
               successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname 
               
               “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s 
               first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated
             aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.Rejoining DRDO

        <div class="left"><h1>Early Life and Education</h1>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October

             1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre
              of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras 
              Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
               father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and 
               imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was 
               a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry
                that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between 
                Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
                [14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers
                 and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His
                  ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and 
                  landowners, with numerous properties and large
                   tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic
                    group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka
                     who claim descent from Arab traders and local
                      women. The family business had involved trading
                       groceries between the mainland and the island 
                       and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
                        pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. 
                        With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the
                         mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
                          fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the 
                          ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam

                           was born. As a young boy he had to 
            sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.
        </br>
        <h1>Career As a scientist</h1>
    </br>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in
     1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of
      the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press 
       Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a 
       member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
       He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but 
        remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] 
        
        Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, 
        
        the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and 
        recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director
        
        of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's 
    approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]     
</br>
<h1>Writings</h1>
In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by 2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons programme as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.[1

        <h1>precidency</h1>
        On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[42][43] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:

        I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet 
        and in other media, I have been asked for a message.
         I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country 
         at this juncture.[45]
        </br>
    <h1>Award</h1>Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities.[152][153] The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.[154] In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.[155] In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".[156]

    In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.[157]
    
    Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state government further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate and ₹500,000 (US$6,300). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to residents of the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of students.[158]
    
    On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in 2015 the CBSE set topics on his name in the CBSE expression series.[159]
    
    Prime Minister Narendra Modi ceremonially released postage stamps commemorating Kalam at DRDO Bhawan in New Delhi on 15 October 2015, the 84th anniversary of Kalam's birth.</div>
